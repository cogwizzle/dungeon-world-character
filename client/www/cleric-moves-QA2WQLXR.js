        You invoke a hungry spirit to possess a recently-dead body and serve
        you. This creates a zombie that follows your orders to the best of its
        limited abilities. Treat the zombie as a character, but with access to
        only the basic moves. It has a +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The
        zombie also gets your choice of 1d4 of these traits:
      </div>
      <ul class="text-sm ml-5 list-disc">
        <li>It's talented. Give one stat a +2 modifier.</li>
        <li>It's durable. It has +2 HP for each level you have.</li>
        <li>
          It has a functioning brain and can complete complex tasks. It does not
          appear obviously dead, at least for a day or two.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        The zombie lasts until it is destroyed by taking damage in excess of its
        HP, or until you end the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1
        to cast a spell.

        Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a corpse whose soul has not yet
        fully departed this world. Resurrection is always possible, but the GM
        will give you one or more (possibly all) of these conditions to fulfill:
      </div>
      <ul class="text-sm ml-5 list-disc">
        <li>It's going to take days/weeks/months</li>

        <li>You must sacrifice ____ to do it</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        The GM may, depending on the circumstances, allow you to resurrect the
        corpse now, with the understanding that the conditions must be met
        before it's permanent, or require you to meet the conditions before the
        corpse is resurrected.
