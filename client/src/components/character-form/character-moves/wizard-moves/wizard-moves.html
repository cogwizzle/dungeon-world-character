      <div>
        A monster appears and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your
        character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier
        for all stats, 1 HP, and uses your damage dice. The monster also gets
        your choice of 1d6 of these traits:
      </div>
      <ul class="ml-5 text-sm list-disc">
        <li>It has +2 instead of +1 to one stat</li>
        <li>It's not reckless</li>
        <li>It does 1d8 damage</li>
        <li>Its bond to your plane is strong: +2 HP for each level you have</li>
        <li>It has some useful adaptation</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        The GM will tell you the type of monster you get based on the traits you
        select. The creature remains on this plane until it dies or you dismiss
        it. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

        Your touch reshapes a creature entirely, they stay in the form you craft
        until you cast a spell. Describe the new shape you craft, including any
        stat changes, significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will
        then tell you one or more of these:

      <ul class="ml-5 text-sm list-disc">
        <li>The form will be unstable and temporary</li>

        Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition
        using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held
        until you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met,
        whichever happens first. You don't have to roll for the held spell, it
        just takes effect. You may only have a single contingent spell held at a
        time; if you cast Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held
        spell replaces the old one.

        The shadows you target with this spell become a portal for you and your
        allies. Name a location, describing it with a number of words up to your
        level. Stepping through the portal deposits you and any allies present
        when you cast the spell at the location you described. The portal may
        only be used once by each ally.

      <ul class="ml-5 text-sm list-disc">
        <li>Speak a few words of your choice</li>
        <li>Give you something they hold</li>

        <li>Truthfully answer one question</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you
        lose 1 hold. While the spell is ongoing you cannot cast a spell.

        A cloud of fog drifts into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of

        sight of the target, it immediately flees. This effect continues until
        you leave the target's presence or you dismiss the spell. While the
